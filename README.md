# Guidebot

This was a short game I made that's available to play [on this itch.io page.](https://fr75s.itch.io/guidebot). Here's the source code for it, so that any of you can freely modify it and such, and so that it is backed up. Feel free to inspect all the stuff, used and unused, here.

Only the source code is here. If you want to install this game, go to the itch.io page.
